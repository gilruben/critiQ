## Database Setup
In postgres, create a database called "critiq"

In the config folder, create a file named config.json. Then, copy the contents
of the configDemo.json file, and paste it into the config.json file you created.

Also, change the "username" field in the config.json file you created. Username
should be your username for the database.

Do the previous instructions for development, test, and production in
config.json.

Then create a database in postgres called "critiq".
